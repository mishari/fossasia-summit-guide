## Conference Photo

By entering the FOSSASIA Summit venue, participants consent to being photographed or recorded for event documentation and promotional use. If you prefer not to be photographed or filmed, please inform the photographers or videographers.

To capture our community together, we will take a **group photo on Day 1, just before lunch, in the main hall.** We warmly invite everyone to join and be part of this shared moment.
