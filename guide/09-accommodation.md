# Accommodation

Bangkok offers a diverse range of accommodation options to suit every budget and preference. For hassle-free travel, choose a hotel near a BTS Skytrain or MRT station. If you’d like to stay close to the event venue, consider the On Nut or Punnawithi areas. For those looking to explore the city's attractions, Sukhumvit, Silom, or Pratunam are highly recommended.
