# Getting Around

Bangkok offers an extraordinary array of transportation options, catering to every budget, comfort level, and adventure preference.

## Trains

Bangkok’s rail network includes **BTS**, **MRT**, **ARL**, and **SRT**. BTS, MRT, and ARL are modern, air-conditioned, and reliable, with fares typically ranging from **15–100 THB**. Routes are easy to navigate using Google Maps or Moovit.

The **BTS Skytrain** is the most convenient way to travel around the city, avoiding traffic while connecting major areas. Many stations support **contactless credit card payments (Visa/Mastercard)** — look for EMV signs at ticket gates.

**Venue access:** The conference venue is a **5-minute walk from Punnawithi BTS Station (E11), Sukhumvit Line.**

For real-time updates, you may download the **BKK Rail App** (available on Google Play and the App Store).

Tickets can be purchased via cash, cross-border QR payment, WePay, or at ticket machines and staffed counters.

## Ride-Hailing Services
Traffic in Bangkok can be heavy and unpredictable. Ride-hailing apps are a convenient option, especially outside peak hours. Commonly used apps include [Grab](https://www.grab.com/th/en/), [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en/cities/bangkok/), [Tada](https://tada.global/), [LINE MAN](https://lineman.line.me/), [InDrive](https://indrive.com/). Grab is generally considered the most reliable and offers multiple vehicle options.

Motorcycle taxis (drivers wearing orange vests) and regular taxis are also widely available. When using taxis, always ensure the **meter is turned on**. Helmets should always be worn when using motorcycle taxis.

## Buses

Bangkok’s bus network is extensive and inexpensive, with routes available on Google Maps and Moovit. However, buses are affected by traffic conditions. Fares are paid in cash.

A bus stop with multiple routes is located **directly in front of the venue**.

## Tuk Tuk

These three-wheeled vehicles come in two varieties: 1) [Muvmi's](https://muvmi.co/) app-based prepaid service offers comfortable rides with knowledgeable drivers OR 2) Street-hailed versions cater primarily to tourists seeking thrilling city tours (negotiate fares in advance).

## Canal boats

Canal boats on the **Saen Saeb Canal** offer a fast and inexpensive way to travel across parts of the city. From **Petchaburi MRT Station**, boats provide access toward the old town area for **12–22 THB**.

## River Boats

The **Chao Phraya River** is another major transport route. From **Saphan Taksin BTS Station**, river boats connect destinations such as ICONSIAM, the Grand Palace, and areas north toward Nonthaburi.

## Bicycles

Bangkok's emerging cycling culture offers an intimate way to explore the city, endorsed by Forbes as one of the [best ways to explore Bangkok](https://stories.forbestravelguide.com/bangkoks-unexpected-outdoor-adventures). While dedicated lanes are scarce, cycling transforms routine commutes into sensory adventures, revealing hidden galleries and local eateries. True Digital Park provides secure bicycle parking near Starbucks for private bicycles, and the [Anywheel](https://www.anywheel.co.th/) bike-sharing system offers convenient pickup points throughout central Bangkok with nearby parking stations on the sidewalk near Punnawithi BTS exit 5 and the sidewalk in front of True Digital Park.

Essential Cycling Guidelines:
- Prioritize sidewalk riding on major roads, maintaining slow speeds and pedestrian courtesy
- Navigate through quieter side streets when possible
- Note that trains accommodate only folding bicycles
- Stay well-hydrated in Bangkok's tropical climate
