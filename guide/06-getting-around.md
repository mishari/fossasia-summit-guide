While dedicated lanes are scarce, cycling transforms routine commutes into sensory adventures, revealing hidden galleries and local eateries. True Digital Park provides secure bicycle parking near Starbucks, and the [Anywheel](https://www.anywheel.co.th/) bike-sharing system offers convenient pickup points throughout central Bangkok with nearby parking stations on the sidewalk near Punnawithi BTS Exit 5 and in front of True Digital Parkk.

- Note that trains accommodate only folding bicycles
- Stay well-hydrated in Bangkok's tropical climate

There are several bike-sharing companies operating throughout Bangkok, you can see a map of their parking locations [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1uNuLkjtv_hm0DIIKNF8R2p8_WCJMtog&ll=13.731116613924478%2C100.52545839095683&z=14). The companies are:

## Ride-Hailing Services
Road-based transport is often the least efficient way to move through Bangkok due to extreme and unpredictable congestion. Travel times can vary by an order of magnitude (10x) without warning.

For the most consistent experience, use ride-hailing apps. [Grab](https://www.grab.com/th/en/) is the market leader for reliability and payment options. [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en/cities/bangkok/), [Tada](https://tada.global/), [LINE MAN](https://lineman.line.me/), and [InDrive](https://indrive.com/) offer competitive pricing but may have longer wait times and inconsistent experiences.

For traditional options, motorcycle taxis (drivers wearing orange vests) and regular taxis are also widely available. When using taxis, always ensure the **meter is turned on** and helmets should always be worn when using motorcycle taxis.
