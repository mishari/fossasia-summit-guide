# Wellness & Leisure

## Traditional Massage
Thailand is renowned worldwide for its massage traditions, offering therapeutic techniques that have been perfected over centuries. Thai massage, known locally as "nuat phaen boran," combines acupressure, stretching, and energy line work to restore balance and vitality. Whilst there are many service providers, [Urban Thai Massage](https://www.spa-urbanthaispa.com/bangkok/) is considered reputable and will offer a 15% discount for our participants if they present their conference badge at their [Surawong location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DexMg2cRHQi4FL5Y8).
