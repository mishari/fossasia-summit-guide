# Payment methods

The predominant methods of payment in Thailand are QR codes and cash, used virtually everywhere from taxis to street food stalls to markets to malls. Credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, UnionPay) are generally used less often and are primarily accepted in more upscale establishments. There are also more niche domestic payment networks built on specific platforms, like True Corporation’s TrueMoney Wallet or the BTS’s Rabbit card.

Thailand’s PromptPay QR codes are a frontend to its bank transfer network and are accessed using mobile banking or e-wallet apps. While they have been widely adopted in recent years, there will still be a few situations where bank transfers are not accepted or are inconvenient, e.g., at stores that only accept transfers via TrueMoney Wallet, or when your phone is out of battery. There may also be other restrictions depending on the mobile payment app you use, and as such, having cash on hand is strongly advisable.

On the other hand, while you can often get by in Thailand with just cash, dealing with change will be inconvenient, and there are some places that only accept cashless payment – primarily self-checkout kiosks and select stores within malls. Usually cashless-only places will almost always accept card, so it is recommended you keep cash along with at least one cashless payment method: either a mobile payment app that supports PromptPay QR codes, or a credit/debit card.

## Getting cash

You can bring in a maximum of THB 450 000 in Thai baht, or USD 15 000 equivalent in any other foreign currency, without needing to declare at customs. As such, the recommended way to bring cash into Thailand is to exchange for Thai baht in your country before departure. Alternatively, you may exchange cash after arriving in Thailand, but note that exchange rates near airports tend to have a significant markup; if possible, prefer bank branches (*not* bank exchange booths at airports) or currency exchanges within malls. Note that you need to present your passport when exchanging currency.

You can also withdraw Thai baht from all ATMs – Thai ATMs accept MasterCard, Visa, UnionPay, JCB and American Express. However, exchange rates may be unfavourable and there may be fees depending on your home bank and the bank providing the ATM, so consider this a backup option.

## Options for cashless payment

The most convenient way to access QR code payments as a foreigner is to sign up for [Kasikornbank’s PAY & TOUR prepaid card][pay-and-tour], and to use it with the [**TAGTHAi Easy Pay**][easy-pay] e-wallet. Not only will you be able to use QR code payments, but you will also have a prepaid Visa card that can be used to withdraw cash at all ATMs and pay fares in most public transit systems. There are several drawbacks however: the TAGTHAi Easy Pay app is slow to load and to process a transaction, taking between 10 and 30 seconds to pay, and the app only supports paying to QR codes registered to shops, not individuals. Additionally, registration and top-ups can only be done with cash **in a foreign currency** at a dedicated KBank foreign exchange booth, not a KBank branch; these booths are found primarily in the airports and in foreign tourist hotspots. This forces you to use these booths’ exchange rates, which are highly unfavourable, even more so than the rates listed on KBank’s website and at its branches. You can expect to receive approximately 7% less Thai baht compared to midmarket rates. <!-- based on personal experience; booth at BKK sold ~39 THB for 1 GBP on 2025-12-16. -->

Thailand’s PromptPay is also compatible with QR payment systems from some countries in Southeast and East Asia. This is limited, however: only specific banks in those countries are supported, and the merchant must be using a supported bank as well (usually the five biggest banks: Bangkok Bank, Kasikorn Bank, SCB, Krungthai and Krungsri (Bank of Ayudhya)). There are also daily transaction limits that depend on your country. See the Bank of Thailand’s [Cross-border Payment][cross-border-payment] page for more details.

If you have WeChat Pay, Alipay, or UnionPay, these are supported at some stores, especially ones owned by Chinese immigrants. However these are by no means universally accepted, so it’s not recommended to rely on them.

## Other

The **Rabbit** card is a special payment network originally made for paying fares for the BTS skytrain, though it is also accepted at some other stores, usually those in or near BTS stations. A full list of [supported stores][supported-stores] can be found on the Rabbit website. To get one, simply ask to buy a Rabbit card at a BTS station\*’s ticket booth and show your passport. (Note: citizens of Iran, North Korea or Myanmar are not allowed to buy Rabbit cards.) You will have to pay THB 200: a THB 100 issuing fee and a THB 100 initial balance. After that, you can top up the Rabbit card in THB 100 increments at any BTS station\*.

\*Also includes stations of other train lines that are operated by the BTS company, namely the Gold Line, the MRT Yellow Line and the MRT Pink Line.
