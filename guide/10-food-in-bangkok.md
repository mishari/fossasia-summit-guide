# Food in Bangkok

Thai gastronomy stands as a living testament to the kingdom's cultural crossroads, where centuries of diverse influences have merged to create one of the world's most celebrated cuisines. Each dish tells a story of cultural exchange, local innovation, and culinary artistry.

While Google Maps offers reliable navigation to nearby eateries including keywords for halal and vegetarian, and food courts (keyword [ศูนย์อาหาร](https://www.google.com/maps/search/ศูนย์อาหาร/)) provide quality meals at reasonable prices similar to hawker centers, Bangkok's dining scene extends far beyond these convenient options.

For those seeking exceptional culinary experiences, here are some selected restaurants.

## Restaurants

- [Kub Khao kub pla](https://www.instagram.com/kubkaokubpla/) - Meaning "rice and fish," this highly accessible, premium restaurant chain offers an extensive menu of boldly flavored, authentic homestyle Southern Thai dishes perfect for both quick lunches and leisurely group dinners.
- [KHAO](https://khaorestaurants.com/) - Boasting a well-deserved Michelin star, this beautifully designed, rice-barn-inspired restaurant elevates traditional Thai culinary heritage into an exquisite premium dining experience showcasing complex, authentic regional flavors.

- [Thong Smith](https://www.instagram.com/thongsmith) - Elevating Thailand's famous street-side boat noodles into a premium comfort food experience, this incredibly popular restaurant serves deeply rich, spicy, and aromatic broths topped with high-quality cuts of Wagyu beef.
- [Sala Rattanakosin](https://www.salahospitality.com/rattanakosin-bangkok/th/) - Situated directly on the banks of the Chao Phraya River, this stunning boutique eatery offers delegates a breathtaking, front-row sunset view of Wat Arun (The Temple of Dawn) to pair with its refined Thai and international menu.

## Food Delivery Services

Bangkok has reliable food delivery services that are easy to use for international visitors. Popular apps include **GrabFood** and **LINE MAN**. All offer English-language interfaces and allow you to filter restaurants by dietary preferences, including **halal** and **vegetarian** options. Delivery is fast and widely available across the city. Insider tip: the Yindii app is a food waste reduction app that will deliver surprise boxes from premium food outlets for 30 - 70% off.

Note: it can be confusing as some vegetarian restaurants serve imitation meat that's described as meat (i.e. pork, chicken) but in effect vegetarian, whilst others will wrongly appear in the search. If in doubt, feel free to ask the local organizers.

## Rooftop Bars

Bangkok's skyline provides a magnificent backdrop for evening dining and drinks. Here are some standout venues that pair spectacular views with exceptional service:

## Late night dining

Bangkok is world-renowned for its late-night food culture, meaning you will never go hungry after dark. While it is true that restaurants located inside major shopping malls typically take their last orders around 21:00, the city simply transitions to a completely different dining scene as the night progresses.

### Dedicated Late-Night Food Hubs
Rather than being unpredictable, late-night street food and local eateries are highly concentrated in vibrant, easy-to-find foodie districts. Heading to [Banthat Thong Road](https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1727263/street-food-paradise) (near Chulalongkorn University) or the legendary [Yaowarat](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Bangkok/Yaowarat_and_Phahurat) (Chinatown) guarantees endless rows of bustling street food stalls, modern dessert cafes, and local restaurants that operate past midnight.

### Midnight Dining Staples
Locals frequently gather at late-night hot pot restaurants, especially traditional mu kratha (Thai BBQ hot pot), many of which stay open until 02:00 or later. Additionally, central areas like Sukhumvit and Thong Lo are packed with Japanese izakayas, late-night pubs, and international eateries catering to the after-hours crowd. The area around Nana BTS station also has a large selection of mostly Middle Eastern restaurants, most of which also serve respectable Thai food.

### 24-Hour Lifesavers
If you need a guaranteed sit-down meal at 03:00 AM, the city features several reliable, round-the-clock institutions:

### Hot pot

Thailand has a significant culture of going to hot pot restaurants, where food is cooked communally at the table, especially to celebrate special occasions. Hot pot places come in many variations, but there are a few main types:

* Thai suki, shabu-shabu, sukiyaki, mala tang: food is cooked in broth in a pot at the table. The pot may have dividers to hold multiple broths in one pot. Each person then scoops up the food they want to eat into their own bowl or plate to have with various dipping sauces.
  - [MK Restaurant](https://www.instagram.com/mkrestaurant): à la carte, serving Thai suki. Follows mall opening and closing times. Price usually between THB 150 and 400 per person. All-you-can-eat available at select locations, THB 499 minimum per person.
  - [Momo Paradise](https://www.instagram.com/momoparadiseth): all-you-can-eat, serving Japanese sukiyaki and shabu-shabu. Follows mall opening and closing times. THB 659 minimum per person.
  - [Suki Teenoi](https://www.instagram.com/sukiteenoi): all-you-can-eat, serving Thai suki and shabu-shabu, with fried sides. Open from 10:30 to 05:00. THB 234 minimum per person.
* Mu kratha: a Thai classic, combining a grill with Thai suki. A mu kratha grill consists of a domed grilling area for thin slices of meat, usually pork or beef, and a broth-filled ridge for cooking vegetables or other kinds of meat.
  - [Bar B Q Plaza](https://www.instagram.com/barbqplaza_th): à la carte, usually found in malls. Follows mall closing times. Price usually between THB 250 and 500 per person.
  - Mom-and-pop mu kratha places: usually all-you-can-eat, sometimes à la carte or by weight (pricing based on how much meat you take; vegetables usually provided for free). Usually with outdoor seating, so some heat tolerance required. These places tend to be cheaper and will be open late into the night. To find one, search “หมูกระทะ” in Google Maps.
